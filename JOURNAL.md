This is my first time using React, so I wanted to document my journey here! 

### Oct. 14-15
I set up my React app today! I also bought a domain name with the Athena Award (https://award.athena.hackclub.com/). 


I made the first box- the "Hello, I'm Shreya!" one. Now I'm at my first challenge, trying to put the sparkles on top (around??) the box.
