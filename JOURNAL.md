This is my first time using React, so I wanted to document my journey here! 

### Oct. 14-15
I set up my React app today! I also bought a domain name with the Athena Award (https://award.athena.hackclub.com/). 


I made the first box- the "Hello, I'm Shreya!" one. Now I'm at my first challenge, trying to put the sparkles on top (around??) the box. 
Edit: It works! I added the sparkles to the *greetings* box, and edited their positions until it matched what I have in my Figma file.

Updates (it's easier to list): 
- made the comet "check out projects" part next to the greetings box. makes it easier to navigate
- when you hover over the comet, it starts flyinggggg
- struggled on making the hover box smaller
- it is INCREDIBLY annoying to add comments... 0/10 would not recommend
- working on the box with my links!!
